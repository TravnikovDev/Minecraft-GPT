# Minecraft-GPT

This project was heavily inspired by [mindcraft](https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft) and reuses many functions from it. Here are the main differences:

- Focuses solely on one AI mode, specifically ChatGPT.
- Fully written in TypeScript and utilizes the Bun.js ecosystem.
- Strongly typed and uses Zod for data parsing to minimize parsing issues.
- Removed AI coding capabilities.
- All bot actions are hard-coded, with AI determining the appropriate action based on the situation.
- The author (Roman Travnikov) is not an experienced Minecraft player, thus the bot is designed to behave like a beginner exploring the Minecraft world.

## Description

Minecraft-GPT is an intelligent Minecraft bot designed to interact with the Minecraft world and players in an engaging, natural manner. The objective of this project is to create a bot that behaves like a new playerâ€”learning, exploring, and interacting with both the environment and other players. The bot is capable of gathering resources, building structures, and engaging in meaningful conversations, all while simulating the actions of a novice Minecraft player.

A standout feature of Minecraft-GPT is its ability to interact naturally with other players, including accepting commands in multiple languages for a more immersive experience. Furthermore, the bot has the ability to interact with other bots, enriching the multiplayer experience by simulating real players and adding dynamic activity to the in-game environment. The bot is powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, allowing it to understand commands and choose actions appropriate for the situation, making it a unique addition to any Minecraft server.

## Features

- **Autonomous Interaction**: The bot can interact with the Minecraft world, including chatting with players, gathering resources, and building structures.
- **Survival Skills**: It performs essential survival tasks such as finding food, crafting tools, and defending against enemies.
- **Custom Commands**: The bot's capabilities can easily be extended with custom commands.
- **Intelligent Conversations**: Powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, the bot can engage in meaningful conversations with players.
- **Multilingual Support**: The bot can accept commands in multiple languages, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- **Bot-to-Bot Interaction**: Bots can interact with each other, simulating natural player behavior within the game world.
